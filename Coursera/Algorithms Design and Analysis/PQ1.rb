Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, 
where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.
Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the 
fast divide-and-conquer algorithm 

At any step in merge(), if left[0] is greater than right[0], then there are 
left.size inversions. because left and right subarrays are sorted, so all 
the remaining elements in left-subarray (left[1], left[2] â€¦ left.length - 1) 
will be greater than right[0]

  left = merge_sort(arr[0, len/2])

  # merge arrays to answ array while they both have elements
